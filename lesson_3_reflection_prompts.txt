When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you work with collabarotive code or working in different locations with different
devices and need to have the same information

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there may be changes in your local repository that you don't want to overlap. 
If you pull automatically you will overwrite uncommited changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Forks is a clone action that occurs in the GitHub servers. You will clone if you have 
access and want to modified that repository. If you don't have access or want to work 
on a separate clone you will fork it. They all work on branches. You will create a new 
branch when you want to modify something different from the current active branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This is useful to compare the possible conflicts there might be between the remote repository
vs the local one
