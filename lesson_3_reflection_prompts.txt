When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you work with collabarotive code or working in different locations with different
devices and need to have the same information

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there may be changes in your local repository that you don't want to overlap. 
If you pull automatically you will overwrite uncommited changes.
